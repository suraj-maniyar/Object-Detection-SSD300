# Object-Tracking-SSD300
Object tracking using Siamese Network

# Theory
When object to track is not known beforehand, it is necessary to perform SGD online to adapt the weights of the network, severely affecting the speed of the system.  
The Correlation Filter (CF) learns to discriminate an image patch from the surrounding patches by solving a large ridge regression problem extremely efficiently.
